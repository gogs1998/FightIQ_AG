## 2. The Methodology: Why This Works
Unlike traditional handicapping which relies on intuition, FightIQ relies on **Mathematical Edge**.
1.  **Dynamic Elo Ratings:** We track fighter strength updates after every single round.
2.  **Boruta Feature Selection:** We use only the 51 most predictive features (e.g., Differential Reach, Age, Strike Accuracy), eliminating noise.
3.  **Probability Calibration:** Our models are calibrated using Isotonic Regression, meaning if we say a fighter has a 70% chance to win, they win exactly 70% of the time historically.

**The Edge:** We bet ONLY when our calculated probability exceeds the implied probability of the odds by >5%. This ensures positive Expected Value (+EV) on every wager.

## 3. UFC 323 Official Positions

### 💎 The "Diamond" Picks (High Confidence + High Value)

#### 1. Tatsuro Taira (vs Brandon Moreno)
*   **Position:** Moneyline (Win)
*   **Odds:** 1.80 (-125)
*   **Model Probability:** **88.4%**
*   **Implied Probability:** 55.5%
*   **Edge:** **+32.8%** (Massive Anomaly)
*   **Rationale:** The model detects a massive divergence. Taira is undefeated, younger, and has superior grappling metrics. Moreno, while a former champ, has shown statistical decline in recent fights (Age Curve). The market is overvaluing Moreno's name recognition.
*   **Recommended Stake (Kelly 1/8):** **5.1% of Bankroll**

#### 2. Mairon Santos (vs Muhammad Naimov)
*   **Position:** Moneyline (Win)
*   **Odds:** 1.40 (-250)
*   **Model Probability:** **90.4%**
*   **Implied Probability:** 71.4%
*   **Edge:** **+18.9%**
*   **Rationale:** A mismatch hidden in plain sight. Santos's recent performance metrics (Striking Differential) are elite. The model prices him at 1.10 (-1000). Getting 1.40 is a steal.
*   **Recommended Stake:** **5.9% of Bankroll**

#### 3. Brunno Ferreira (vs Marvin Vettori)
*   **Position:** Moneyline (Win)
*   **Odds:** 1.91 (-110)
*   **Model Probability:** **68.0%**
*   **Implied Probability:** 52.3%
*   **Edge:** **+15.7%**
*   **Rationale:** Vettori is known for durability ("The Orc"), but Ferreira's "Chin Health" adjusted power rating suggests he is one of the few who can crack him. The model favors the finisher over the decision-machine here.
*   **Recommended Stake:** **2.1% of Bankroll**

### 💰 The "Value" Dogs (Underdogs with Edge)

#### 4. Bogdan Guskov (vs Jan Blachowicz)
*   **Position:** Moneyline (Win)
*   **Odds:** 2.10 (+110)
*   **Model Probability:** **62.3%**
*   **Edge:** **+14.6%**
*   **Rationale:** Blachowicz is 42+ years old. The "Age Decay" feature in our model heavily penalizes him. Guskov is dangerous and younger. We are fading the aging legend.
*   **Recommended Stake:** **1.7% of Bankroll**

#### 5. Chris Duncan (vs Terrance McKinney)
*   **Position:** Moneyline (Win)
*   **Odds:** 1.53 (-188)
*   **Model Probability:** **76.2%**
*   **Edge:** **+10.9%**
*   **Rationale:** McKinney is statistically the most volatile fighter in the division (First Round or Bust). Duncan has the durability metrics to survive the storm and win.
*   **Recommended Stake:** **2.6% of Bankroll**

### 🎯 Prop Snipes (High Variance, High Reward)

*   **Mansur Abdul-Malik by KO/TKO:** (Model: 52%)
    *   *Why:* Abdul-Malik has a 96% win probability. The model predicts a finish is more likely than not.
*   **Grant Dawson by KO/TKO:** (Model: 45%)
    *   *Why:* Unexpected. Dawson is a grappler, but the model sees a path to a TKO (Ground & Pound). If odds are > +140, it's value.
