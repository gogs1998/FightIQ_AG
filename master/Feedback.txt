This is seriously clean now. 🌶️ You’ve basically got “camera-ready” level prose. I’ll just flag a *few* ultra-minor polish items you might want to tweak, plus give exact drop-in edits.

## 1. Tiny consistency tweaks

### 1.1 Conclusion: specify flat-bet ROI

In the Conclusion you say:

> “Empirically, FightIQ delivers a 23.47% flat-bet ROI in 2024 and a mean 16.31% ROI in 2025…”

I’d keep the “flat-bet” qualifier here too, so it aligns with the Abstract and §5.2.

**Edit:**

> “Empirically, FightIQ delivers a 23.47% **flat-bet** ROI in 2024 and a mean **flat-bet** ROI of 16.31% in 2025, with substantial compounded growth under a conservative one-eighth Kelly strategy.”

### 1.2 Optional: match “flat-bet” hyphenation everywhere

You use “flat-bet ROI” in some places and “Flat Betting ROI” in others.

Up to you, but if you want perfect consistency you could standardise on **“flat-bet ROI”** everywhere:

* 5.1 bullet:

  ```markdown
  - **Flat-bet ROI:** **23.47%** (Outstanding).
  ```

* 5.2 bullet:

  ```markdown
  - **Flat-bet ROI:** **8.27%**.
  ```

That’s purely style; what you have is still perfectly clear.

## 2. Optional micro-edits

These are nit-level and totally optional:

### 2.1 Capitalisation / wording in 2.2.2

You have:

> `diff_strike_landed_per_min` = (Fighter A Strikes) - (Fighter B Strikes)

If you want it more “mathy” and less “Englishy”:

```markdown
- `diff_strike_landed_per_min` = (Fighter A strikes landed per minute) − (Fighter B strikes landed per minute)
```

Same information, just slightly more precise.

---

### 2.2 Brier-score sentence (5.3)

Currently:

> “…reduced Brier score by approximately **10–15%** relative to market implied probabilities, confirming that the edge arises from superior probability estimation.”

If you *do* also see a nice gap vs your Elo baseline, you could sneak that back in:

```markdown
Across 2024–2025, FightIQ reduced Brier score by approximately **10–15%** relative to market implied probabilities and by **≈20%** relative to a pure Elo baseline, confirming that the edge arises from superior probability estimation rather than staking aggressiveness alone.
```

(Adjust the ≈20% to whatever your actual number is; if you don’t have it / don’t like it, your current sentence is fine.)

## 3. Sanity check: everything else

* Kelly naming is now consistent: “one-eighth Kelly” everywhere ✅
* “no shuffling” and time-series CV are explicit ✅
* Leakage example + “features only from fights strictly before (t)” is very clear ✅
* Clear separation between flat-bet ROI and Kelly growth, with definitions ✅
* Tone is assertive but not over-claimy ✅

From here, you’re honestly in “formatting” territory: LaTeX, arXiv template, or whatever wrapper you want around this core text.

If you tell me your target format (e.g. *“NeurIPS-style LaTeX”*, *“technical blog post with figures”*, or *“investor deck bullets”*), I can turn this exact version into that shape in one shot.
